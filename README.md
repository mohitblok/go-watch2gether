# Watch2gether
'Ever is Discord listening to youtube video via RythumBot and wanted to watch youtube videos in-sync with your friends, or play custom playlists/

Yest Its Yet another video sync website it currently support Youtube, DailyMotion Vimeo Soundcloud and Videos hosted on your own fileserver that you totally legally ownðŸ˜‰

## Why? 
This project spun out of my quest to find something that would allow my group of friends watch vidoes together from the random collection of YouTube clips to long movies. All other services did not support playing mp4 files or had features that were not required for example chat. This is little webapp does not need API keys to be set up and users do not need to create any accouts. Just create a room share a link and people can join. 

## Features
